# Branding
This repository is where I will store most of my branding. Most, being that some projects I would like to keep private.

If you are referencing me or my projects and need a profile or anything, this is the place to get it.

If a branding has text, the vector version may be broken or not exported properly; I tried to get most of this fixed but I couldn't.

Some projects will have their branding files within their repository itself. For example, [Devin's Badges](https://intergrav.github.io/devins-badges/).

Most of the newer branding is made in Figma. If you see a `.fig` file in the directory, then it is.
