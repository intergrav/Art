# Branding
This repository is where I will store most of my branding. Most, being that some projects I would like to keep private.

If you are referencing me or my projects and need a profile or anything, this is the place to get it.

If the branding has text, the vector version may be broken as Figma can't seem to export text with outlines properly.

Some projects will have their branding files within their repository itself. For example, [Devin's Badges](https://intergrav.github.io/devins-badges/).

Most of the newer branding is made in Figma. If you see a `.fig` file in the directory, then it is.
